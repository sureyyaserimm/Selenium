<h1> Re:Eileen Dover university application </h1>

<p>Dear Eileen,</p>
</p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of
your PhD next year.
I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections. </p>

</p>Starting dates: 1 Sep 2020, 1 Oct 2020 </p>

</p>   We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,
however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester;
the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li> First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
    <li> Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
    <li> Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
</ul>

<p> Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer. </p>
